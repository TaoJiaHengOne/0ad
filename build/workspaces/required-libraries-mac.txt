You can install all of 0AD's dependencies using MacPorts, available from
http://www.macports.org.

After installing MacPorts, use it to install the following packages:
- boost
- libsdl
- spidermonkey
- xercesc
- wxWidgets
- ffmpeg

This can be done with the command: sudo port install <package>

These packages bring in other dependencies, such as XFree86, libogg and zlib.

You also need to install DevIL manually. It depends on some libraries downloaded
through MacPorts above, so get those first. Next, obtain DevIL 1.6.8 RC2 from
http://openil.sourceforge.net/download.php. Then extract the archive, and run
./configure, make, and sudo make install.

WARNING: The current Mac build does not seem to work in full-screen mode.
Please set windowed=true in binaries/data/config/system.cfg, and set the xres
and yres parameters to a suitable window size.
