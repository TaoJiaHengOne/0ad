You can install all of 0AD's dependencies using MacPorts, available from
http://www.macports.org.

After installing MacPorts, use it to install the following packages:
- boost
- libsdl
- spidermonkey
- xercesc
- wxWidgets-devel

This can be done with the command: sudo port install <package>

These packages bring in other dependencies, such as XFree86, libogg and zlib.

WARNING: The current Mac build does not seem to work in full-screen mode.
Please set windowed=true in binaries/data/config/system.cfg, and set the xres
and yres parameters to a suitable window size.
