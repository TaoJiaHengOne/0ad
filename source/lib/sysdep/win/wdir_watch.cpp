// rationale for polling:
// much simpler than pure asynchronous notification: no need for a
// worker thread, mutex, and in/out queues. polling isn't inefficient:
// we do not examine each file; we only need to check if Windows
// has sent a change notification via ReadDirectoryChangesW.
//
// the main reason, however, is that user code will want to poll anyway,
// instead of select() from a worker thread: handling asynchronous file
// changes is much more work, requiring everything to be thread-safe.
// we currently poll once a frame, so that file changes will happen
// at a defined time.


// rationale for using I/O completion ports for notification:
// alternatives:
// - multiple threads with blocking I/O. a good many mount points
//   and therefore directory watches are possible, so this is out.
// - normal overlapped I/O: build a contiguous array of the hEvents
//   in all OVERLAPPED structures, and WaitForMultipleObjects.
//   having to (re)build the array after every watch add/remove sucks.
// - callback notification: notification function is called when the thread
//   that initiated the I/O (ReadDirectoryChangesW) enters an alertable
//   wait state (e.g. with SleepEx). we need to poll for notifications
//   from the mainline (see above). unfortunately, cannot come up with
//   a robust yet quick way of working off all pending APCs -
//   SleepEx(1) is a hack. even worse, it was noted in a previous project
//   that APCs are sometimes delivered from within Windows APIs, without
//   having used SleepEx (it seems threads enter an "AWS" sometimes when
//   calling the kernel).
//
// IOCPs work well and are elegant; have not yet noticed any drawbacks.
// the completion key is used to associate Watch with the directory handle.


// list of all active watches. required, since we have to be able to
// cancel watches; also makes detecting duplicates possible.
//
// only store pointer in container - they're not copy-equivalent
// (dtor would close hDir).
//
// key is intptr_t "reqnum"; they aren't reused to avoid problems
// with stale reqnums after cancelling;
// hence, map instead of vector and freelist.
