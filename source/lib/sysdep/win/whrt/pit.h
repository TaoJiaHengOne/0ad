// note: we don't access the PIT for two reasons:
// - it rolls over every 55 ms (1.193 MHz, 16 bit) and would have to be
//   read at least that often, which would require setting high thread
//   priority (dangerous).
// - reading it is slow and cannot be done by two independent users
//   (the second being QPC) since the counter value must be latched.
//
// there are enough other tick sources anway.
