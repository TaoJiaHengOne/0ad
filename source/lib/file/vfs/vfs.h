// VFS paths are of the form: "(dir/)*file?"
// in English: '/' as path separator; trailing '/' required for dir names;
// no leading '/', since "" is the root dir.

// there is no restriction on path length; when dimensioning character
// arrays, prefer PATH_MAX.

// pathnames are case-insensitive.
// implementation:
//   when mounting, we get the exact filenames as reported by the OS;
//   we allow open requests with mixed case to match those,
//   but still use the correct case when passing to other libraries
//   (e.g. the actual open() syscall).
// rationale:
//   necessary, because some exporters output .EXT uppercase extensions
//   and it's unreasonable to expect that users will always get it right.
