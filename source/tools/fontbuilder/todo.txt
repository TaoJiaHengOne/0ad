* Optimise storage of duplicated bitmaps (e.g. e and e-with-some-accent,
  comma and semicolon, anything and fullwidth versions, etc)
  
* Optional antialiasing

* Optional outlining (text with e.g. yellow fill and black outline
  is made by drawing the black outline font and then the yellow
  normal font)
  
* Are the one-pixel black borders necessary? I don't trust graphics
  cards not to leak a little bit, especially when they force texture
  compression and filtering and antialiasing
  
* Work out when I should say 'character', when 'code point', and when 'glyph'
