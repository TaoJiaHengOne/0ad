These libraries must be installed in order to compile.


Definitions:

$install := directory where the compiler is installed.
$lib := directory where the compiler looks for lib files;
  typically = $install/lib .
$include := the same for header files (= $install/include).
$GL := directory containing OpenGL headers.
  VC6: $install/Include/GL;
  VC7: $install/PlatformSDK/Include/GL.
$binaries := directory containing system/ and data/ .
