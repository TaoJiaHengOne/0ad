$install := directory where the compiler is installed.
$lib := directory where the compiler looks for lib files;
  typically = $install\lib .
$include := the same for header files (= $install\include).
$GL := directory containing OpenGL headers.
  VC6: $install\GL;
  VC7: $install\PlatformSDK\Include\GL.
$binaries := directory containing system\ and data\ .


TODO:

- OpenGL extensions:
  download glext.h and put it in $GL .

- ZLib (v1.1.4.8751)
  download zlib.zip; extract headers into $include,
  lib files into $lib, and DLLs into $binaries.
  If you get an error 'zlib.dll not found', rename zlib-1.dll to zlib.dll
    in directory $binaries (cause of the error is unclear ATM).

- libpng (v1.2.4)
  download libpng.zip; extract headers into $include,
  lib files into $lib, and DLLs into $binaries.

- Xerces: [required if compiling GUI]
  download xerces-c_2_3_0-win32.zip .
  put xerces-c_2.lib in $lib, and xerces-c_2_3_0.dll in $binaries;
  copy xerces-c_2_3_0-win32\include\* into $include .
