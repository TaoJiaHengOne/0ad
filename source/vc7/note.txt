Tested with VS 7.0. I've never tried with 7.1, so if someone
does, let me know how it works out.

Known problems:
- When reading files like xml files, its working directory is
  vc7/, but when reading things like font it looks in
  binaries/. I haven't investigated why, seems very odd.
  Ultimately the xml file reading's root dir should be
  binaries/ too.

/Gee

Known solution :))
- I put the GUI init code before VFS init (which changes the dir
  as you mention to binaries/data), so that it'd work as you had it.
  When you're ready, just move all data to binaries/data, move
  the GUI init after vfs_set_root in main.cpp, and we're go.

p.s. we only need .vsproj and .sln in CVS; .ncb is built by VC.
