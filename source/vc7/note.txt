Tested with VS 7.0. I've never tried with 7.1, so if someone
does, let me know how it works out.

Known problems:
- When reading files like xml files, its working directory is
  vc7/, but when reading things like font it looks in
  binaries/. I haven't investigated why, seems very odd.
  Ultimately the xml file reading's root dir should be
  binaries/ too.
