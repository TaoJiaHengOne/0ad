    <History>'Huerta' is a term that can mean either farm field or orchard. In historical terms, the Iberians tended to growing grains and vegetables, including a variety of roots, greens and artichokes (large blue thistle-like flower-heads), grape vines, and fruit trees ranging from the olive and fig to the apple. The Iberian Peninsula was an agricultural surplus area. </History>
