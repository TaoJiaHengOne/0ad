    <History>The Equites Extraordinarii were the best of the cavalry of Rome's Italic allies (the socii) that were picked out by the commanding Consul and served under him directly. They functioned about identical to their infantry counterparts. The Italic cavalry was of better quality and quantity then the citizen cavalry of the Republic, and were highly prized for service. </History>
