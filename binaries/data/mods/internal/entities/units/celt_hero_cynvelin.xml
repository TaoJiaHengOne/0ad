			<History>Cynvelin was a powerful ruler centered in the territory around modern day London. Ruling the Catuvellauni from Camulodunum, he was a warrior king who conquered a neighboring tribe and was referred to by the Romans as the King of the Britons. Eventually Cynvelin retired to become the arch-druid of Siluria, but was taken to Rome with his son upon Caradoc’s capture. According to legend, the Apostle Paul baptized Cynvelin into Christianity before he died in Italy.</History>
