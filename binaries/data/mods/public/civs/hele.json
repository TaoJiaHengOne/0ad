The Hellenic peoples of the Dorian, Ionian, and Aeolian tribes swept into modern day Greece from 3000 BC to around 1100 BC in successive waves that eventually supplanted the previously established cultures of Mycenae and Minoan Crete. They were most active during the period of colonization that took place in the 7th and 6th centuries BC, the Greco-Persian Wars (499-449 BC), the Peloponnesian War (431-404 BC), and the conquests of Alexander the Great (4th Century BC). Their civilization would endure until their final absorption by Rome in 146 BC.",

					"History":"Xenophon (c. 430 B. C. to c. 355 B. C.) was a Greek soldier and (later) historian who was born in Athens of an oligarch family and was a student of Socrates during his youth. In 401 B. C., Xenophon joined an army of Greek mercenaries lead by Clearchus and four other generals who were aiding Cyrus the Younger in his military campaign against his brother, King Artaxerxes II. He initially went along as a civilian observer and guest of his friend Proxenus who was one of the five generals. Unfortunately for the Greeks, Cyrus was killed in the Battle of Cunaxa in 401 B. C. and the 10000 Greeks found themselves alone in enemy territory, more than 1000 miles from the nearest Greek colony. In addition, the leaders of the force and a hundred captains were treacherously murdered during a negotiation by the Persian satrap Tissaphernes. On the very night after the assassination of Clearchus, the other generals and captains, Xenophon endeavored to rally the spirits of the surviving officers, successfully, and through the night they reorganized the army as if it had not been decapitated of its leadership. Through the timely intervention of a civilian hanger-on the Greek phalanx met the new day confident and ready to fight again, survive regardless of the odds against doing so. Xenophon was elected one of the new Greek leaders chosen to lead the army in its retreat out of Persia. In a march that lasted five months, traveled over 1500 miles, and overcoming many obstacles (both external and internal), they finally reached the colony of Trapezus (now Trabzon, Turkey) on the Black Sea, and then further found their way by land and sea legs back to the Greek homelands in a journey that took more than a year and a half altogether. As one of the five new Strategoi and most junior at that (having never been a soldier), Xenophon is given the task of commanding the rearmost division, the position that turned out to be the most dangerous during the ԁnabasisԬ or ԍarch Up CountryԮ Xenophon repetitively demonstrated his brilliance and leadership qualities in effecting new organizations of light troops and cavalry to include the tactics of their employment in the protection of the phalanx in countering and overcoming their adversaries along the route of march to a degree that he becomes the acknowledged leader of the entire force even though Cheirisophus was the senior strategoi who commanded the van and all the others strategoi outranked him. The story of the retreat from Cunaxa, which Xenophon himself wrote in the third person (as was the custom of the times), is one of the most famous feats of all time in recorded military history. Xenophon went on to fight and lead troops in numerous battles then later write numerous books on military tactics, organization and command throughout the remainder of his lifetime. Other than the legacy of the Anabasis itself his legacy left to the annals of warfare really took effect when Phillip II of Macedon and his son Alexander the Great (also a stude3nt of Socrates for a time) succeeding him put Xenophon's knowledge of warfighting to work for them and the latter went on to conquer most of the known world at the time."
