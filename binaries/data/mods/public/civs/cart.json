	"History": "Carthage was founded in either 814 B.C. or 813 B.C. by a Tyrian Princess named Elissa or Dido. The culture spanned over seven hundred years. In 146 B.C., Carthage (the center of civilsation) was brought to its knees by the Romans. They are probably best known for the usage of elephants in battle. Not only did they ferry them across the Mediterranean, but they were also taken through the alps for a sly attack from the north of Rome. The Carthaginians were most active in the 4th and 3rd centuries B.C. Some famous Carthaginians were: Hamilcar Barca (who fought in the First Punic War), his son Hannibal Barca, and Maharbal (Hannibal's cavalry commander). Some famous battles were: Acragas in 406 B.C., Zama in 202 B.C., and the Siege of Carthage 148-146 B.C.",
