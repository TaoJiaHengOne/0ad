NOMAD MODE
Only available for the "Random" map type.
Players will be randomly dropped on the map without a Civic Center.
Requires the "Medium" starting resource setting in order for players to be able to build their first one.
Don't immediately start building the Civic Center, scout for a good location for your base first.
