SPARTAN HOPLITES
A Spartan warrior stood true to his code and military training from 7 years of age. From that time forth, war and the state's security were his sole focus.

Spartiates are a Greek Poleis branch Super Infantry unit. They have great armour and attack power, but are consequently slow and expensive. The "Othismos" technology allows Spartans to form into the deadly Phalanx formation.
