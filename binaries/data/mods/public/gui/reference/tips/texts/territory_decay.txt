TERRITORY DECAY
Structures too far off an allied territory root (usually a Civic Center) gradually lose capture points.
Slow down or reverse the decay process by garrisoning some units in the structure.
When the decay is completed, the structure will be given to the player owning the closest territory root or Gaia.
