    Previously all move commands during a turn were
    queued up and processed asynchronously at the start
    of the next turn.  Now we are processing queued up 
    events several times duing the turn.  This improves
    responsiveness and units move more smoothly especially.
    when in formation.  There is still a call at the 
    beginning of a turn to process all outstanding moves - 
    this will handle any moves above the MaxSameTurnMoves 
    threshold.  
    
    TODO - The moves processed at the beginning of the 
    turn do not count against the maximum moves per turn 
    currently.  The thinking is that this will eventually 
    happen in another thread.  Either way this probably 
    will require some adjustment and rethinking.

    Warning: Movement costs are a subtle tradeoff between
    pathfinding accuracy and computation cost. Be extremely
    careful if you change them.
    (Speeds are safer to change, but ought to be kept roughly
    in sync with costs.)
