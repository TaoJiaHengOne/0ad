    <History>A place for a farmer to pen his animals. Garrison a sheep, goat, or cow here to gain a trickle of the food resource. Garrisoning an animal here also "fattens" them so that they may be slaughtered and gathered for a quick burst of food. Camels and horses can be captured in the wild and placed in the Corral. Unlike normal corraled animals, which generate food, the Corraled Camel/Horse functions similarly to a relic. As long as it remains in the Corral, the resource cost of training camel-mounted units or horse-mounted units (as appropriate) is reduced by a fixed amount.</History>
