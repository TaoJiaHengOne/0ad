    <History>The Ptolemies invited Greeks and Galatians (Gauls) alike to settle in Egypt within military settlements called cleruchies (klēroukhia). Under this arrangement, the settlers were given a plot of land, or a kleros, and in return were required to serve in the pharaoh's army when called to duty. This created a upper-middle class of military settlers who owed their livelihoods and fortunes to the pharaoh and helped grow the available manpower for the Egyptian army. A side effect of this system was that it drained the Greek homeland of military-aged men, a contributing factor to Greece's inevitable conquest by Rome.</History>
