    <History>The Akropolis was usually a fortified citadel in the upper part of the city. The Athenian Akropolis was renowned for its marvellous temples, among which was the Parthenon, while the Acro-Corinthus was highly prized by the Macedonians for its strategic location and good defences. Fortresses (also called a "phrourion") were also built to guard passes and atop hills in order to command plains and valleys below.</History>
