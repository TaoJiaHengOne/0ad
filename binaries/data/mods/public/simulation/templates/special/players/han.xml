    <History>The Han dynasty was the second imperial dynasty of China. Founded by the commoner Liu Bang, the empire lasted from 202 BC to AD 220 with a short break from AD 9 to AD 23 when Wang Mang took the throne, making it the longest imperial dynasty in Chinese history. The Han dynasty was a period of relative peace, as well as cultural and technological growth, and for that reason is considered the first "Golden Age of China". The name of today's largest ethnic group in the world, the Han Chinese, derives from this very period.</History>
