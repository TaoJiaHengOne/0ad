    <History>Of all the merchants of the ancient world, the Carthaginians were the most traveled. Their vast fleet of trading ships went as far as Britain and down the coast of West Africa. Culturally sensitive, the Carthaginians would make allowances for the particular customs of their trading partners, some transactions taking place without direct contact or negotiation. Thanks to the long voyages of Carthaginian merchants much territory was explored and even colonized.</History>
