		"Description" : "The players start on two opposing islands, both with a very jagged relief that will make landing difficult.\n\nThe small and very mountainous island of Corsica has made it a disputed and undisputedly hard to conquer island. Originally occupied by the Torreans, it was later settled by Etruscans, Phocaeans and Syracusans who mainly established ports. Conquered by Carthage, it was taken from them during the first punic war and united in 238 BC with Sardinia to form the \"Corsica et Sardinia\" province.  The Corsicans regularly revolted and over the course of a century, the island lost two thirds of its Corsican population.",
