			<Specific>Thracian Peltast</Specific>
			<Civ>Hellenes</Civ>
			<History>Peltasts were javelinists originating in Thrace but their form of combat was widely copied by the Greeks, Macedonians, and Persians. Equipped with a small oval or crescent shield, a peltast would charge at enemy formations whilst hurling his javelins then fall back to avoid close combat. They wore no armor and were at a significant disadvantage against heavy infantry and cavalry, relying on their speed for survival.</History>
