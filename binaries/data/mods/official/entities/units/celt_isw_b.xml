			history="Celtic warriors were armed with a long double-edged iron sword of extreme beauty and power. While rare and often confined to the upper class, the sword was able to chop through shields and armor with ease. Most Celts fought stripped to the waist with their hair spiked with lime carrying a large body shield, but the richer members of society were able to procure helmets and chain mail hauberks. A fully equipped Celtic warrior was the equal of any “civilized” soldier."
