			history="The sword was actually not as common among Celts as most people would think. It was a weapon usually reserved for the wealthy or those who were able to plunder a sword from someone less fortunate than they. The Celts who did have swords were renowned for their power and skill with the blade. The blade was 2 sided, long, and usually single handed. It was said to be an extension of their arm."
