			history="Some have argued that Picts are not truly Celtic people, but actual aboriginals to the British Isle. I do believe that they are an offshoot of the Celtic peoples, if you disagree with me, I'll scan some pages out of a book that have proved to me that they are. They resided north of Hadrian’s wall where several crossbows have been dug up that carbon dating show are within our time period. Also a few stone carvings with a crossbow like weapon with a hooded man. It is unknown if it was something the Picts invented themselves or if it was introduced by the Romans. A Pict's fighting technique was not as ‘honourable’ as a true Celt. They were the inventors of the typical highland style guerilla warfare that would be copied for centuries after their submission."
