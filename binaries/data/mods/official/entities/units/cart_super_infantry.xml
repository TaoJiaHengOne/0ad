			<History>The Sacred Band was a group of elite troops dedicated to the service of Tanit, patron goddess of Carthage. Wearing distinctive white linothorax cuirasses and bronze helmets with a black band above the forehead they fought as an elite cavalry formation. In addition to providing crack troops, the unit trained Carthaginians aspiring to command Punic mercenary armies. Specially picked troops carried the unit standard emblazoned with the goddess’ symbols into battle.</History>
