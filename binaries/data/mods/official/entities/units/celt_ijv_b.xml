			history="Gaesum means spear. Gaesatae were a group of warriors outside of 'normal' Celtic society. They typically fought naked. They were usually young warriors for hire, fighting wherever the wind took them. They typically carried 4 spears with them: one stout spear for hand to hand combat, and 3 smaller spears for throwing."
