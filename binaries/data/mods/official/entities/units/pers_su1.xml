			history="The Amrtaka (or, as they are more commonly known, Immortals) were the elite of the Persian army, handsomely equipped with armor and weapons, including swords which were rare weapons in the normal ranks. A unit of 10,000 men, their number was always kept to full strength whenever a man was killed or wounded, resulting in their nickname. They were ferocious fighters and well respected."
