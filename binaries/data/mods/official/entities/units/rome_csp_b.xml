			history="Before the Marian reform, only the wealthy could serve in the cavalry. Notwithstanding, it has always paled in comparison with Roman infantry. Initially, it was comprised of 300 equites divided in 10 turmae. From the middle of II c. BC onward, Rome started relying on auxiliary cavalry of Thracians, Numidians, Gauls and Germans."
