			history="The gastraphetes was a large crossbow braced against the soldier’s stomach, hence the name 'belly-bow'. It was used to launch darts too large for conventional bows and was used mainly in siege situations by either side. Over time it developed into the oxybeles, which is essentially a large version of the gastraphetes on a mount."
