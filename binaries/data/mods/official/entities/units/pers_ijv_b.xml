			history="Javelin throwers were an important arm of the Persian infantry, giving added close range punch to the archers and able to close with the enemy if necessary. Many javelinists were recruited from the peoples of Asia Minor, including the Phrygians, who fought with hide shields and what armor they could find. In their day they were rivaled in skill by only the Thracian peltasts."
