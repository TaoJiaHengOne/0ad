			history="Archers were not of great importance to the Hellenized armies of the Mediterranean, but the Carthaginians fielded archers called up from Mauritania. They were armed with light bows that were able to knock down opposing troops, including heavily armored opponents such as the Romans. Mauritanians wore little if any armor, relying on their speed to escape attackers."
