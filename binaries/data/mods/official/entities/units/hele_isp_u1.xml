			rollover="Hoplites were the very symbol of Hellenistic prestige and citizenship, armed with a spear and a large round, bronze-coated shield known as a hoplon. Armor was heavy, with bronze helmets and a cuirass of either bronze or linen, in addition to greaves. Hoplites fought in a tight formation called a phalanx, guarding each other with their shields while they attacked the enemy with their spear or a short iron sword."
