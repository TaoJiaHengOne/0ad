			history="The Hastati were young men over 20 years old who made up the first line of heavy infantry in the Punic War era Republican army. Initially they threw pilum at the enemy and then engaged the enemy with swords. They were the first heavy Roman troops to engage in a battle. Usually they had enough money to purchase cheaper armor."
