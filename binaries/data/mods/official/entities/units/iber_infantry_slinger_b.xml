			<History>Iberian slingers were the undisputed masters of the weapon and extracted a high toll of the enemy. Going into combat scantily clad at best, the slinger carried three slings tied around his waist, each of a different length allowing him to attack opponents from all ranges. Unlike other cultures, the Iberian slingers threw rocks instead of specially made lead shot.</History>
