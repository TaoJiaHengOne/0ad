			history="Being a woman in Celtic society was remarkable better than any other social society at this time. Women were viewed as equals to men. The woman had control over every piece of property she owned as she came into marriage. In marriage, she had more value than her husband; she controlled the domestic life of the home. The bloodline of the family also passed through the woman. If a man was a noble or king, it was also not uncommon for women to take leadership positions if the husband died. Celtic women were said to be fair to look upon, but also as strong as their husbands."
