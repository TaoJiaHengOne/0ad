			history="The Triari were veterans of military service, usually in their 30s or 40s, with money to afford the best weapons and equipment. They made up the third line of heavy infantry, armed with stabbing spears. If the Hastati and Principi could not defeat the enemy, the Triari would come forward and finish them off. Usually they didn't have to fight. "
