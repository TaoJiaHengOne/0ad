			history="Numantinos were citizens of the city of Numantia and members of the Celtiberi tribe living in the centre of the Iberian Peninsula; particularly famous for their resistance to Roman subjugation culminating in the Siege of Numantia which lasted 8 months. Rather than submit to the Roman victors, almost the entire nobility committed suicide instead of surrendering to be paraded in a Triumph and/or sold into slavery as the rest of the population subsequently was."
