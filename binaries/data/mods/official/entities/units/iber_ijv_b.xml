			history="Lusitani occupied the lands in the west central Atlantic coastal region of Iberia (central modern day Portugal) and were descended from the earliest migration of Celts, Urn field culture, whom mixed with the indigenous peoples of the region. They were probably the most warlike of the peoples of the peninsula, often fielding roving bands of young warriors whom would raid other tribes even at some distance from their homeland. They conducted at least one fully fledged war of numerous campaigns over a period of years against the Romans, under the command of their chief at the time, Viriato."
