			<History>Oxybeles were the logical development of the gastraphetes, a large crossbow mounted on a heavy tripod. It launched heavy bolts using a bow of far greater power than its predecessor, requiring a lever operated winch system to draw it. In accuracy, range, and power it outstripped all other bolt throwers of the time.</History>
