			history="Roman women in the Republic were in a similar state as their Greek counterparts. When a Roman woman married their dowry and property passed to their father-in-law, while she herself became the property of her husband. Their job was to raise the children and helping in farm work or running the family business. It was a sign of affluence when a man’s wife did not have to work."
