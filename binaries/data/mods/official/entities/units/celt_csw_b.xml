			history="Owning a horse was a sign of nobility. Although the primary unit in the Celtic army was the infantry, they had great respect for their horses. They honoured their speed and their bravery. They actually assigned two warriors to one horse. When one warrior was tired in battle, they would run back to camp and the other warrior would get on and go fight. Another method was to take their mount and tether it to a stake in the ground then go fight on foot and run back to their horse when they needed to flee. They fought as mercenaries in the Punic wars. Primarily used in ambushes and hit and run tactics. After the fall of Gaul, the Romans used the Gallic warriors and horses to greatly strengthen their army."
