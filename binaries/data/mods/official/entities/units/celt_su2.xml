			history="Chariots were employed by the Celts of the British Isle. They were noisy, and intimidating. They were used to attack in motion by running over people, and hurling javelins. However they also were used to quickly deliver and provide escape from the battle as a transport. They were also used to quickly move men to places in the battle line that were weak and losing momentum. The wheels of the chariot were ringed with seamless iron."
