			specific="Thracian Peltast"

			history="Peltasts were javelinists originating in Thrace but their form of combat was widely copied by the Greeks, Macedonians, and Persians. Equipped with a small oval or crescent shield, a peltast would charge at enemy formations whilst hurling his javelins then fall back to avoid close combat. They wore no armor and were at a significant disadvantage against heavy infantry and cavalry, relying on their speed for survival."
