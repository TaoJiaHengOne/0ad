			<History>Decurions each commanded a cavalry squad of ten Equites, three of which made up a turmae. They wore either Greek-style armor or Roman chain mail hauberks split at the thigh to allow for riding. Armed with a spear for throwing or stabbing, they would use a gladius for close combat. A round shield called a parma was a major source of protection once the heavy Roman horseman had closed with their opponents.</History>
