			history="Celtic traders were known for trafficking in many different goods. These could range from metal work and iron objects to slaves. Indeed, Britain proved to be a steady supply of slaves for the Romans. In trade the Celts often received Roman weapons, armor, and tools. Celtic traders were usually land bound, traveling on foot or by animal."
