			history="Mede Spearmen comprised the main infantry regiment in the Median Empire. They also remained of very high importance during the Achaemenid period, ranking second only to the Immortals. They were widely used throughout the Empire, as illustrated by the fact that even Ionian cities under Persian rule were guarded by Median battalions."
