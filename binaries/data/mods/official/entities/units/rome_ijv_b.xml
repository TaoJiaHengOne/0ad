			history="Principi were the second line of heavy infantry. Older than the Hastati, but were otherwise identical in appearance and armament except that the Principi had better armor. They would enter the combat once the Hastati had worn down the enemy, throwing their pilum into the enemy ranks before charging in with swords."
