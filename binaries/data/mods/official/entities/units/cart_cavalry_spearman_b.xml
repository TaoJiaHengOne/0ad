			<History>The Samnites were one of the southern Italian tribes who defected to Hannibal’s army during the Second Punic War. While known for their light infantry, the Samnites produced the greatest horsemen in Italy, armed with light spears that could be thrown or used over arm. Swords were plentiful near the coast, but were not often worn in central Samnium.  Armor was plentiful, if light, including the peculiar bronze anklets worn by some Samnite horsemen.</History>
