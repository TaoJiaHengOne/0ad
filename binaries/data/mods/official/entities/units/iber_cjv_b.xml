			history="While not differing greatly from the other Iberian cavalry, the javelinists gave the horsemen the added sting of long-range attack coupled with brutal close combat. They did not use stirrups or saddles and were renowned for their horsemanship. They were highly sought after as mercenaries, albeit expendable ones."
