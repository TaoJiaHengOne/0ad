			history="The Iberian Peninsula is literally littered with stone, ceramic, and leaden sling bolts at archeological sites, so evidence suggests that slingers were a common enough unit that they are tribal generic. While it is a popular notion that Balearic Slingers, possibly the best in the ancient world, were 'Hispanic' because the islands now belong to modern day Spain, they are a Carthaginian unit relative to the times. Iberian slingers carry 3 slings like those of the Balearic."
