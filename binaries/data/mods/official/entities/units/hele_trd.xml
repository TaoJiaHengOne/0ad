			history="Traders were private merchants who traveled from place to place buying and selling goods. Italy, Carthage, Egypt, Cyprus, Scythia, Phoenicia, and Asia Minor were all major ports of call for Hellenistic merchants. There they bought everything from grain and dates to rugs, pottery, spices, gems, and wool, even elephants from India and slaves from Scythia."
