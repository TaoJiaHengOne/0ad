			<Rollover>The javelins thrown from a horse's back were probably 3 at most. The idea was to quickly advance with 3 in hand, then throw them all. After you had done that it was time to switch to your secondary weapon which was usually a spear or a sword. However, in the game - these units will only have ranged attack.</Rollover>
