			history="Quite a few temples and altars were scattered about Carthinginians territory, given up to the worship of various gods in a pantheon that, regrettably, is mostly lost to time and destruction. The structure shown is one found just west of the Bagradas River on a tributary that was dedicated to a pantheon of gods ranging from traditional Phoencicio-Carthaginian to Egyptian and Hellenic. It was actually built of a golden-hued marble (some others from a pink-hued marble also famously quarried in the Carthaginian homeland). Note that Tanit and Baal-Haamon were the were the two principal gods worshipped by a population that was quite religious, therefore their ‘effigies’ should also appear on the façade of the temple or as statuary in front of it, perhaps flanking the entrance."
