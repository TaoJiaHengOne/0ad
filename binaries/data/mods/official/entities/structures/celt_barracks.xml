			<History>I could not find any evidence of a central military structure, but I?m giving them one for gameplay reasons. Their training would have been performed in an open area, and on the battle field. They would have been housed in their home. The blacksmith would probably have been a part of the blacksmith?s home. The men were responsible for making or scavengering their own weapons.</History>
