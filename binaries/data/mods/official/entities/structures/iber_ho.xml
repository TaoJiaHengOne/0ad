			history="Iberians structures of the time were typically built either entirely of stone or with stone stub walls with 'adobe' raising them on up to the roof lines above them. Roofs were then, depending on the economic status of individuals, covered with a composite of mud and binding vegetable and waterproofing asphaltic materials, or slate stone, or in many cases in the region, with so-called Spanish roofing tiles. Some house roofs were constructed at an angle to allow any rainfall to run right over the occupant's front door. The adobe walls would have been plastered and 'whitewashed' for all but the most humble or neglected of abode."
