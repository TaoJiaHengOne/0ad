; Logging settings:
;
; All messages are logged into mainlog.html. These numbers control which go into
; interestinglog.html and are displayed in the console.
; Each component can have one of three 'interest' levels:
;   0 makes no messages interesting (i.e. none are sent to interestinglog / console)
;   1 (the default) makes errors/warnings interesting
;   2 makes all messages interesting
