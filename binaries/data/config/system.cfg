; COMMAND LINE OPTIONS:
;
; (note exact spelling of the actual switches, e.g. -nopbuffer, not -NOPBUFFER)
;
; -m=MAP		load the file <MAP> (string) instead of the default test01.pmp
; -g=F			set the gamma correction to <F> (floating point; 0.0 < F <= 1.0)
; -e			show entity graph
; -v			enable VSync, i.e. lock FPS to monitor refresh rate
; -novbo		disable Vertex Buffer Objects; may solve graphics-related problems on older/buggy graphics cards
; -nopbuffer		disable Pixel Buffers;         may solve graphics-related problems on older/buggy graphics cards
; -f			enable fixed frame timing; ?
; -s			enable shadows
; -xres=N		set desired screen X resolution to <N> (integer)
; -yres=N		set desired screen Y resolution to <N> (integer)
; -conf NAME=VAL	set config variable <NAME> (string) to <VAL> (string)

; System settings:

novbo=true
shadows=true
vsync=false

; Adjusts how OpenGL calculates mipmap level of detail. 0.0f is the default (blurry) value.
; Lower values sharpen/extend, and higher values blur/decrease. Clamped at -3.0 to 3.0.
; -1.0 to -1.5 recommended for good results.
lodbias = -1.0

; Language selection: (currently "english" or "pseudogreek")
language=english

; You can specify these as well, but the default (keeping the current resolution) is
; probably best for most people.
; xres = 1024
; yres = 768

; Logging settings:
;
; All messages are logged into mainlog.html. These numbers control which go into
; interestinglog.html and are displayed in the console.
; Each component can have one of three 'interest' levels:
;   0 makes no messages interesting (i.e. none are sent to interestinglog / console)
;   1 (the default) makes errors/warnings interesting
;   2 makes all messages interesting
