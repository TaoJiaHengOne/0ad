08/02/04 - v0.0.4.1
	- minor change to the model/bone system to allow support for models generated using the (currently boneless) pmdexp MAX exporter

07/02/04 - v0.0.4.0

	- toolbar for switching between tool modes, or to return to the null "do nothing" mode
	- converted from 8 to 16 bit heightmaps
	- scenario load/save
	- removed TextureTools->Add; need to add TextureTools->Rescan at some point

	found in data\objects directory tree
	- bugfix: list of available objects now scrolls up/down, not left/right
	- added grid and shaded wireframe modes for terrain again
	- minor cosmetic change: default elevation of light changed to 45
	- added map resizing to the same size maps (Small, Medium, Large, Huge) as dictated by DD
	- evil MFC hackery: changed message loop processing to switch to periodic updates instead of 
	change-driven updates (a prerequisite for animation)
	- added info box; only info it shows at the minute is the FPS, though
	- removed random heightmap generation
	- automatic creation of texture types and automatic loading of textures from data found in 
	data\terrains\textures directory tree

18/01/04 - v0.0.3.2
	- Added (broken) alphamap support as a temporary workaround until proper implementation complete

	- Automatic update of model/texture on clicking "<<" from object editing back to terrain editing
	- Altered SMD conversion to dump to user-chosen file

		- default view closer to terrain

			(Map->Lighting Setting->Unit Ambient Color does affect lighting, though)
		- XML loading/saving of basic object definition files

	- PNG support for terrain and model textures
	- all alphamap support disabled until implementation of correct alphamapping
	- "fine" grid view temporarily disabled
	- changed from generic triangle soup ray acceleration to regular grid based approached; faster terrain load/build times as a result
	- fixed bug in terrain lighting due to converting a color as a quantised normal rather than a regular FP color
