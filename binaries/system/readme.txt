Last Update: 29th August 2004

This is the 0 A.D. readme file. Its content is somewhat limited, since it is primarily here to stop the system/ folder from disappearing from CVS now that all binaries are stored elsewhere. ;)

If all has gone well, there should be two binaries in this folder:

* ps_test.exe: This is a customised debug version of the build. It runs like crystallised treacle, but it does keep better track of memory. If it crashes or you otherwise encounter an issue, please post the two crashdump files that appear in your data/ directory as a bug report at http://bugs.wildfiregames.com, along with the date of your build, and we will be able to trace the crashdump to isolate the error, and hopefully fix it.

* ps.exe: Run this for a release version of the build. It's faster, but it won't generate an accurate crash dump. So if it crashes, we'll have a hard time isolating the source. For testing purposes, it's therefore best to run ps_test.
