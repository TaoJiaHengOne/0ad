# 0ad Documentation

- Lots of general documentation is on the Gitea wiki: https://gitea.wildfiregames.com/0ad/0ad/wiki

- Doxygen documentation is published at https://docs.wildfiregames.com/pyrogenesis/

## Building the Doxygen documentation

To generate the Doxygen documentation: run "cmake -S . -B output && cmake --build output".

If you build the documentation with cmake, the output is located in the folder html inside your
specified build directory.
