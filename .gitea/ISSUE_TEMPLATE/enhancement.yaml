        **Important Note:** Gameplay and balance changes require preliminary discussion, and
        consensus must be reached with the Balancing team.<br>
        If this is a gameplay change, please add the *Needs Design Input* label, and open a forum
        topic for discussing your proposal.<br>
        You should link that forum topic in the ticket Description above.
