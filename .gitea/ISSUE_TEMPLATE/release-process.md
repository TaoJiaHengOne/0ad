# Release XX Process

This task tracks the progress of the next release. **Please do not report issues with the nightly build or with release candidates here:** instead create a new issue and set its Milestone to the relevant release.

All details about each step are documented in [ReleaseProcess](wiki/ReleaseProcess).

After performing steps, post a comment on the task, so that it appears in the activity feed and notifies followers.
